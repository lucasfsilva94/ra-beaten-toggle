## üß© Project

**RA Beaten Toggle** is a Chrome extension that adds a checkbox to the [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org) user page.  
When enabled, the checkbox hides all games marked as **Beaten**, allowing you to focus only on what remains.  
Uncheck it anytime to bring them back.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Adds a "Hide beaten games" checkbox to the completed games section.  
- Dynamically hides/shows items with `title*="Beaten"`.  
- Saves user preference using `localStorage`, keeping the state after page reload.  
- Keeps the original "Hide completed games" checkbox side by side with the new control.
